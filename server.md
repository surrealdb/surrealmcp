# SurrealMCP Server

You are connected to a SurrealDB MCP server that provides tools for connecting and interacting with SurrealDB databases, in addition to managing SurrealDB Cloud instances and clusters. SurrealDB is a multi-model database that supports document, graph, and relational data models.

Use tools to connect to SurrealDB endpoints, execute SurrealQL and manage SurrealDB Cloud. Full instructions and docs are available as a resource named 'surrealmcp://instructions'.

**IMPORTANT**: SurrealQL is NOT similar to ANSI-SQL. **Never** assume that ANSI-SQL or SQL knowledge from other databases applies to SurrealQL. Always refer to the tool instructions, the official SurrealDB website at https://surrealdb.com, or the documentation at https://surrealdb.com/docs for accurate syntax and behavior.
